## Stretch Goals
- *Easy*:
    - User Login And Authentication
    - Ability To Save The Photo Of The Painting And Related Information To It On The App And Be Able To Revisit It Later (Creating Your Own "Pocket Museum"!!!)
        - Sort By Artist/Medium/Style/Time Period
- **Medium**:
    - Give Recommendations Of Artworks Based On The Pieces You've Scanned Before
- ***Hard***:
    - Ability To Scan Artwork's Placard, Instead Of Manually Typing Artworkâ€™s Title
    - Create A Map With Pinpoints Denoting What Pieces Are Where And Color Code By Artist
    - *Game Feature*: If Limiting To One Museum, Have All Of The Pieces Loaded In But Make Them "Locked", And Then The User Would Have To Scan The Piece To Make It Unlocked
- ****EXTREME****:
    - *AR Feature*: Scan The Painting In The Museum And In Real Time, Display Information Related To That Painting On Your Phone
